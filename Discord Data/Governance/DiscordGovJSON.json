I don't understand why they don't offer UNI rewards besides the fees. It's a UNI pool for Christ sake. \n\nIt doesn't make any sense to offer fee rewards+LP tokens that you can deposit to liquidity mining pools for ETH-DAI for example, and not offer it for UNI pools (only fee rewards). Not to mention the way more less riskier assets DAI,USDT to impermanent loss.\n\nSo UNI-ETH is very risky and has the lowest incentive and you lose money by providing liquidity",

   "Content": "> What are the chances of a proposal to allow the reallocation of tokens to people who accidentally sent UNI tokens to the UNI swap smart contract address? I accidentally did this through a copy and paste error... gutted\n@Wizard88  I also think chances are low, it may be \"tough luck\". But the rationale is that it is likely you were trading UNI in early volatile times and it was part of your implicit  risk (tactics). That the essence of the airdrop was for Uniswap to become more decentralized and for that,  new coiners were targeted  to understand its value and those targeted newcoiners would have all clicked on UNI gift link, and interacted by the Dapp contract (buy, sell, claim) , and hence probably exempt from making this error since they would not have had any need to interact with the contract at a lower level.",

A proposal could be of the spirt to incentivize with a second airdrop anyone with a wallet that provided liquidity after the 1st of September and before some determined date X. Only for wallet that have withheld \n a certain X% or their 1st airdrop coins. Unfortunately the pool rates are too low and UNI tokens are not an input, they are the output. If a newcoiner puts in 1 ETH worth into the ETH/WBTC pool (crypto pool) at the current claim-rate they would be looking at being rewarded less than 1 UNI per week as yield. So obviously the pool yield is not enough to incentivize newcoiners with little capital in dumping, and this may make the UNI token even more  decentralized and valuable.",

Your idea is definitely sound, however it is not a governance proposal. If you would zoom out and look at a way of offering bounties for informative videos it would actually become a proposal. Not that I would flag your post but I guess thats what happened.\n\nat the same time, discord is a very noisy platform which sucks for in depth discussion because the text speed is too fast and fractured. So basically Uni is missing ways of facilitating in-depth discussion on specific topics, somewhat like special interest groups. I guess if there were a broader forum with a specific exposure/marketing section, this post would have been perfect there.",

   "Content": "> You need 10M UNI delegated to you to formally create a proposal. \n> \n> But since Uniswap uses Compound's gov. contracts, we could also make use of autonomous proposals. If my math is right: Using Compound's ratio would make it so that autonomous proposals only require 10,000 UNI. I believe that 10,000 number could also be adjustable. Here's a blog post detailing them: https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-autonomous-proposals-354e7a2ad6b7\n@Kolten  is there a way to get a concrete answer for this? Happy to ramp up to 10k tokens if that’s actually the right number",

   "Content": "So I think the next competitor to uniswap is going to be decentralized exchanges on L2 solutions like xdai,  seems like Uni swap could pre-empt this by the launching its own Uniswap on the L2 chains, and the community voting to incentivize LP moving to the uniswap L2 chain.  There would be a huge advantage to uniswap too if it pulled traders and LP to an L2 chain as we wouldn't even need to redistribute the .005 fee from LP's the protocol could raise fees and the cost benefit to everyone would still be positive as the overall fees paid for trade on a L2 chain would still be far less.",

I have no problem discussing an airdrop for their users, but lowering the quorum seems intentionally designed to allow them to push through their airdrop *despite* the regular uniswap users, and without offering them anything or consulting with them.\n\nThat is a major misalignment of incentives all around, in my opinion.",

   "Content": "@Tharsonius I think the issue with the token model is too serious for memes. The team is mute on anything $UNI related. So it's up to this community to take this seriously. The token is once again one of the worse performing assets in the top 100. Every time BTC goes down, UNI dumps, BTC goes up, UNI goes sideways. There is either too much inflation and/or a lack of value capture. There is a proposal to incentivize a UNI/ETH pool, but it will not pass because the community doesn't have the votes. Dharma does, and the dev team is happily promoting this as a good thing. I'm not seeing why anybody should value governance when clearly they won't have a voice.",

   "Content": "So I'm trying to explore how hard that would be.  One of the challenges is that we were going to do \"utility pricing\", meaning you pay for what you use.  However, that is a lot more complicated when you need a governance proposal to pay every bill.  I'm trying to figure out if there is some mechanism by which we could come up with a flat-rate that is \"probably enough to not have to worry about overages\".  The other issue is that UNI is volatile, so having a contract for UNI rather than USDC or DAI (or even ETH) introduces a lot of risk to the company.  I can cover that by charging more, or I have to do something more complicated like setup a contract that somehow trustlessly swaps governance UNI for DAI and then puts *that* into the Sablier stream.",

The announcement made a distinction between \"users\" and \"addresses\" in who gets the distribution. Then it added \"addresses that attempted to interact with the contracts but failed\". Addresses aren't necessarily one-to-one in terms of natural person to address but it's at least pretty well understood that \"users\" use and for Uniswap, using it is a process that either adds liquidity, removes liquidity, or makes a swap (in simple terms). This creates confusion when on one hand \"users are entitled to the airdrop\" and on the other hand \"addresses that interacted with the contract successfully, and also those who tried\" are explicitly included and that's the final word from the devs. Outside of Dharma there are still other users who certainly used Uniswap's services, perhaps thinking they have used it directly, perhaps not caring that they did but knowing that it was a possibility, and perhaps purposefully chosen to do so but on a platform that uses a proxy contract. Using isn't mutually exclusive. I think we need to settle that question even if just to set the outer boundaries for the future as to what constitutes as \"using\" Uniswap.",

It’s not the case that delegation = blind trust, but the current proposal -> vote timing assumes that’s the case. \n\n48 hours is plenty of time to see a proposal, do analysis, and see where your delegate’s head is at.

To many it looked like the governance was being captured by a few hands/larger projects for the benefit of their users, while the $UNI token depreciated and had little value in the hands of retailers. IMO, outside of optics, there isn't much of an issue. The airdrop is small considering the rate of inflation. And supporting projects building with Uniswap is good long term.",

You need to let go of that grudge and stop treating uni token as a badge of honor token and to earn a quick buck or two and focus on adding value to uni token and uniswap protocol with exciting features, things that make people go WOW and not WTF are these guys doing.

We worked round the clock with several stakeholders to pull together a viable proposal. \n\nUnivalent amassed 10m votes with the express purpose of lowering the voting thresholds. While we wouldn't have pursued that on our own, Univalent made clear that they would not vote for any other proposals. So that was 10m votes that were not available for our proposal. And there were only 47m UNI delegated at all, which made our proposal impossible to pass without Univalent.\n\nThen we got frustrated with Univalent because even though they had the votes to make the proposal, as well as the vocal support of us and other delegations, they were dragging their feet in submitting the formal proposal. So we submitted exactly the proposal that they wanted, in the hope that after proposal, whether passed or not, Univalent would dissolve and their 10m votes would become available to use for other proposals.",

You need to let go of that grudge and stop treating uni token as a badge of honor token and to earn a quick buck or two and focus on adding value to uni token and uniswap protocol with exciting features, things that make people go WOW and not WTF are these guys doing.

   "Content": "> @brendan_dharma because the whole idea of decentralizing governance is to take it out of the hands of the company and put it into the hands of the users???\n@Chris Blec Hmm, I think there is nuance to this. \n\nFirst off, \"decentralizing\", IMO, is the movement towards less concentration of power. Moving from 1 decision maker to 2-of-3 vote would be \"decentralizing\". IMO, \"decentralizing\" does not intrinsically mean \"put power in the hands of users\". \n\nSecondly, the initial UNI distribution did a lot to decentralize Uniswap's governance, and UNI inflation will continue to increase decentralization.\n\nFinally, whether you like it or not, investors and team members hold tokens right now. It's hard for me to understand the logic by which delegating their votes to Dharma is not an increase in decentralization",

The UNI/ETH ties the UNI and ETH ecosystems more closely together (mutually beneficial to supply locking), and allows those who receive airdrops to route through ETH pairs more easily without pushing prices. UNI/ETH pairing also has more opportunities when it comes to maker loans/other staking services in the longer term.",

Don't think anyone on the call's mind was changed, but the reframing of the contention into the purpose of distributing treasury funds was somewhat useful for y'all. Distributed to users vs. development grants (which some teams may or may not need). I did hear a comment from cComp maybe that he wishes there was more discussion around 1. The initial problem, 2. The solution to that problem. I honestly think there was:\n<https://gov.uniswap.org/t/retroactive-airdrop-excludes-proxy-contract-users-e-g-dharma-matcha-etc/1222/7>\n\nAt this point the problem was stated, but without a solution. But there was definitely discussion around the solution as well starting around here:\n<https://gov.uniswap.org/t/retroactive-airdrop-excludes-proxy-contract-users-e-g-dharma-matcha-etc/1222/35>\n\nSide notes, I don't care which way the proposal goes, and I do wish chris acted as a more neutral moderator, but that's my personal opinion.",

I saw codebam's last responses, and they seemed a lot more like misunderstanding and disagreement than just plain FUD. \"there's no way you did this just for the gas,\" \"except that they tried to lower quorum so they could change whatever they wanted\" These comments aren't just straight FUD, they're a bit on the accusatory side and I think he went too far, probably believing he was safe to do so. However, it's extremely minor, and he's *also* illustrating what he believes to be threat vectors. A permanent ban from the Discord seems heavy-handed (was he also banned from the governance forum?). He seemed to be a dev and someday he might be a good solidity/ethereum developer. There's been an increasing defense afforded to Dharma. You \"obviously\" banned him for being useless and annoying, nothing more. When Noah said he was \"actively\" spreading disinformation, he was likely implying he was *intentionally* and *actively* doing so. My main point is just that a permaban seems too heavy-handed, it's not good for the whole. I don't know if you had other reasons for the ban.\n\nAlso, I've looked a few times and I don't see a rule in #✅rules  that disallows \"cold mentioning\" people. I've seen Micah ask people *several* times not to cold mention people, but I'm not sure if he means just @ admins or @ everyone.",

All they're doing is farming UNI, dumping immediately to cause nonstop-built in sell pressure, and then pumping up the price of their external farm project token to dump and rugpull on the newbs. \n\nBy enabling a new UNI pool and allowing LP's to vote where large uni whales are already involved with the external farm projects to potentially farm a larger percentage of the UNI rewards, it could potentially make the price dumping even more severe and it would allow them to vote in favor of more dumping to favor short term gains over the long term goals of UNI. They could 5x short uni and long their token and multiply their bags in short order.\n\nI propose a 2 month time lock on the uni rewards and an additional incentive for each month the reward claim is delayed (for example, each month after they get an additional 10% bonus on their entire rewards)\n\nThis will stop the farms in their tracks as it'll  be hard to convince anyone that a farm wont rug pull after 2 months or they'll create vesting tokens that might be worthless if the team rugpulls as well.\n\nIf anyone proposes a new liquidity pool without Farm Abuse Mitigation (FAM), it's our duty to vote NO.",

The reason I am asking is the TVL on Dracula is really small, doesn't seem to have caught on. if that's the only platform with this automated draining protocol, it's currently insignificant, and not worth halting incentivizing the UNI/ETH pool. However if you can point to other platforms doing the same, and we can estimate the aggregate TVL to be a significant percentage, then I would agree we need some mitigation ASAP.

For the first one, there's already talks of enabling LP to votes, so hopefully it can be addressed in a subsequent proposal. For the second, I agree but I would say it's an needed incentive to prevent farmers from selling and short sellers from continuously dumping on holders. I think Augusx1211 also said something similar, that the incentive felt artificial. I get that, but IMO that's the best fix we got that doesn't require new code, audit, etc, etc. Again, a more long term sink would be better indeed.",

   "Content": "> Incentivizing the UNI/ETH pool will not accomplish the goal of creating a \"relation between Uniswap and $UNI\"\n@brendan_dharma True, I agree, and that's why it feels artificial to many. But it will curb the short selling and the farmers dumping (which is based an articificial incentive of $UNI). Now I am not saying two wrongs make a right, but I understand the pool incentives are meant to grow the network, the number of $UNI holders so that further decentralize the Uniswap governance. So I get why the Uniswap team did that, but unfortunately, without an incentive to hodl, farmers dump (and short sellers have a field day). So this incentive further this goal of growing the network and curbs the \"bad\" incentives, that's why I see it as a fix, rather then a solution.",

From now until then, we have plenty of data telling us what will happen to the $UNI token. I know some people thought the sharp depreciation was market related, but I think by now there is a consensus that it is due to the current token model. I understand your point, but the market is also making a point. If the market was making that point every now and then, that'd be one thing, but it has made that point consistently every week. So, IMO, a fix is needed to prevent $UNI from consistently and systematically leaking value.",

Short term traders participate in zero zum games that don't create value\n@Po there is a difference between price action and token model. A token is designed to align the interest of the actors that make up a community. Self-interest/greed is not a bad thing, when it is aligned with the self-interests of the other actors that make up a community or network. You want to say it's okay for investors to subsidize farmers and other actors. But so far in crypto, the largest set of actors in any projects are hodlers. It's one thing if the price action is down for market reason, but this is not the case. The token model is punishing holders and rewarding farmers that dump on hodlers.

Hodlers are subsiziding farmers. That's what happening. They are also asked to subsidize airdrops on top of that. You see no problem maybe because you are farming?",

There's a diminishing return for having TOO much liquidity. As you can see - liquidity is increasing and trading volume is decreasing. Most of the attracted liquidity is just leeching UNI rewards. Stop the incentives, leechers will leave, trading volume won't take a hit - I'm 100% sure.",

The auction itself is a means to prove that you are active and aware of what is happening with UNI fee's, with this auction you lock in your UNI to the auction to prove your ownership of x% amount of UNI. Once you prove you are \"active and aware\" by participating in the auction, you can then go through the list of tokens the contract holds to send in a claim using your auction proof of UNI to receive proportion of that token to your UNI owned?",

Those wanting to claim, can only claim by burning UNI they own? I was thinking more of a claim tokens by auction proof. The burn is more of a \"if you dont claim then the tokens are rolled over into next auction keeping the claim tied into the contract\".",

I think you shouldn't even have an opinion on the topic unless you've read and internalised the above blog post. \n\nI think simply \"stablecoins as dividends\" works really well in the long run, and I think Curve chose the right path regarding this. This way people get the cash flow from owning CRV (by locking to veCRV), but they freely choose what to do with that cash flow, whether the compound it back to more veCRV, or to do something else.\n\nBuyback&burn first forces you to accept that more UNI is bought with the 0.05% cash flow, and then it would be simply burnt. It can hurt the long-term capitalisation and growth of Uniswap as proposed in the blog post, if done this way. \n\nI'm surprised that the tentative consensus in the Uniswap community seems to be towards a buyback&burn model. It would be a mistake in my opinion. \n\nImagine buying stocks that are supposed to pay dividends, then the company never pays dividends but rather always automatically buybacks shares, and then *the company treasury would always burn those shares*.

Following the second line, I would argue that a Synthetix style staking mechanism that distributes trading fees is way better at encouraging holding UNI than a burn mechanism. Using BNB as an example there was a ton of analysis done a year ago about how the Burn was a tradable event, people buying before and selling. We can argue the nuances about how BNB doesn't buy on the open market leading to a buyer of last resort, but that still doesn't change my point of it not incentivizing holding the token.  Overall both options would make UNI a better token than it currently is, but I would waaaaaay rather see UNI being a productive CF producing asset for token holders than just a deflationary asset.",

It's great that we're all so passionate about Uniswap but we need to accept that thousands of people having an equally valid voice and opinion is going to create enormous gridlock.\n\nI imagine over time people will begin to just establish their own mental model of a \"board of directors\".

But each time we do a call, the board actually comes to decisions about what to put forward to the rest of us.",

A stationary bandit thereby begins to take on the governmental function of protecting citizens and their property against roving bandits. In the move from roving to stationary bandits, Olson sees the seeds of civilization, paving the way, eventually for democracy, which by giving power to those who align with the wishes of the population, improves incentives for good government.\"",

In Uniswap's governance plan, you need to add a way for the core uniswap team to override the proposal if the core team thinks otherwise.\n@dlokman well the team has a lot of UNI  + most of UNI holders trust them so if they want to push a proposal they can easily do it",

Giving away free coins just leads to an initial dump and the coins will inevitably be purchased at a depressed price by whales and institutions. So there goes our decentralized dreams.",

Also create a secondary income source for holders so the admin fee of the system and the LP fees; (hold for admin fees or stake for admin fees + LP fees)",

I noticed recently that activity volume on ETH-UNI is down(I am yet to do real Math here). This shows that LM miners don't hold their UNI and they don't really value it as a store of value and they were not interested in using it to participate in governance.

LPs take the risks of impermanent loss and gain the fees. I know what you actually mean is that Uniswap can let the LPs make enough money without liquidity mining. Maybe you are right. Maybe we could have other ways to make the community treasures more available. The current issue is, how can we agree with disagree, and keep trying to make it better, rather than hold our own opinions and doing nothing.",

   "Content": "Uniswap 2 can run w/o governance of course, it was coded before governance\nUniswap 3 will be able to run independantly from governance\nGovernance still controls treasury, still has the same mandate to help uniswap grow.\nTbh it's a good thing Uniswap will continue to run independantly from governance b/c right now governance does almost nothing. the only proposals we had were for a shady retroactive airdrop ( I say this, and I would have received 800 from the first phase of this airdrop if it had been voted). the dev team really **can't** count on governance. the big delegates are just sitting there, doing basically sweet nuthin'. or at least, it's starting to look like it very much.\nAlso, the purpose of UNI is to get access to fees eventually. But it's only going to be worth it if Uni grows a lot more IMO. Incentives campaigns can help a protocol grow, as you know.\n\nUniswap has the potential to steal a lot (more) marketshare from CEXes, so I'm pretty sure there are some forces at work behind the scenes. There is a chance that it could explain why governance (= very much controlled by big delegates) has been so stale/uninteresting for now. (Except the nice discussions we have on the governance forum of course). So, to wrap this up, it's a very good thing that Uniswap 3 continues to runs independantly from governance, because it could stay in a deadlock for a long time. That being said, with more active big delegates, governance could also be an asset to the protocol, instead of a deadweight.\n\nPS another reason why big delegates seem to be asleep at the wheel right now could also be that V3 is imminent and they have been told to wait for the release/announcement. Just another guess. We can't really know.",

   "Content": "@research_omega BTW for sake of completeness if somehow you would implement this there would be 2 ways to implement this (the good and the bad one).\n\nYou could use the ERC20Receiver interface on uniswap (having a function called when an ERC20 transfer has occur) that would assert failure.\nAnd having all ERC20 tokens support Receiver (checking does the destination implements ERC20Receiver and if so call onERC20Received). (like http://erc721.org/ does).\n\nAnd an other solution would be for all ERC20 to store all the TX somewhat (saving the history in state) and allowing uniswap to read it, then uniswap would be able to see who sent him some coins. (would be very complicated an expensive and thus **bad**).\n\nThe main problem is that way too many ERC20 tokens doesn't support ERC20Receiver (which is one of the thing 721 fixes).\nThe problem of starting to use ERC20Receiver today is that there is very little insentives to do so:\n- This is somewhat complex to implement\n- Very few receivers contract exists and would take advantage of it.\n- Very few tokens support forwarding so writting an ERC20Receiver would be almost useless (as almost no tokens support it).\n\nBut I still think there is value in starting to use it. We are in an egg chiken problem and starting to use it, as an optional feature (as lack of better option) might drive his usage up in the future.",

   "Content": "So, I checkeck gov.uniswap.org and if I understand it correctly, we COULD turn on the fee-switch for UNI-holders today (independently from whether that is a good or a bad thing) and while (surprisingly few) people have tried to start the corresponding governance-process approx. 25 days ago, no full / real proposal has been made by anyone about that feeswitch, meaning that we cannot even vote on switching fees so far? 😄 \n\nMaybe I just got it wrong, but otherwise this is really surprising to me since I'd have bet that this decision would be of utmost interest to many holders (not me, too few UNI in my bag^^). This is not criticism but only a question about whether I missed something and otherwise a declaration of surprise on my end of this story 😄",

Does a single wallet / person need to have 1% of all UNI (either himself or by delegation) to create that proposal?\n\nIt still is interesting since I'd have thought that precisely people with bigger holdings might have an interest in the fee-switch (eventhough the fees might be short-sighted).\n\nOnce I saw something like a pre-vote?

And the UNI token contract address matches the one in the wallet (so no fake tokens involved). But still, it shows I can't vote -- it says \"Your voting power 0 UNI\" and sends me to check the FAQ of \"Why I can't vote?\". As the FAQ talks about the snapshot block number and having tokens at that time, this is not the case in my case. So, any ideas why I still can't vote?",

The latency/infra cost of pinging MM's with an order outweighs the price benefit of routing outside of Uniswap. This will only happen if Uniswap is hyper liquid and block times are <<15s (e.g. on a rollup). Additionally, most aggregator routing schemes involve marginally increased UX and gas costs (although this is mostly an approval related cost which will subside as the approval flow is deprecated with account abstraction)\n\n> 2. Incentivize direct routing with $UNI. **Uniswap governance is sitting on ~$5 billion of UNI that could be used to incentivize direct flow, rewarding both takers and routing interfaces.** Not sustainable as t → ∞ but worth it if it allows #1 to come to fruition.",

Are these automatically done by discourse after the snapshot vote or does the proposal need to be moved into the next stage by an admin? And then, are these voted on changes then manually made by devs one the vote is completed?\n\nBasically just looking for a full walk through from initial idea to implementation and how that actually happens.

   "Content": "okay so I have some thoughts on the Uni governance and wanted to share them. Could people let me know what they think\n\nThe first is the structure\n-Some of the changes that I would think is needed is to decrease the threshold to create a proposal, this will not be on the main page but on a secondary/tertiary page  \n-Reduce the threshold own to a much smaller dollar worth of UNI or a percent of market cap, then allow to reach a formal platform when it reaches lets say 100-1000x worth of UNI and then maybe 2-3x on top of that to the worth of UNI to be successful proposal. This would be pretty similar to the way COMP does it. \nSo there will be three layers: one with most proposals... those that gain traction and hit the secondary threshold will go on a highlight page where those can see the main proposals...afterwards the third threshold is needed to officialize the proposal\n\nThe problem with UNI's governance is that not only does it make it *very*difficult to pass proposals (which honestly isn't to bad of a problem, should probably be reduced a little further) but more importantly, the ability to even ***propose*** an idea is tunneled down to only so many individuals. This makes the ability to propose **centralized**. This is counterintuitive to the point of decentralized governance. Thus, having these extra layers will allow for more conversation and decentralized method of gov. \n\nHowever, the parameters for the above thresholds should also vary with time\n- the price of UNI \n- the number of uni \"active\" - not locked in cex's nor smart contracts (the rational behind this would be as governance becomes easier and common, then there would be more inflow of tokens into wallets and we would see it become easier to reach the above threshold. so you want to maintain the optimum difficulty despite more people joining)\n-also circulating supply which would influence the above factor",

If anyone has an idea send it there I'll probably add it.\n\n- Support for V2 pools.\n  This would be really usefull for the tiny tokens that havn't moved to V3, currently V3 is really good at trading stuff like ETH, stable coins, ... but if you want to sell your mTSLA into USDT, the whole path will be V2, while actually it's likely that only the mTSLA is better on V2, all the rest of the path is better on V3.\n\n- ~~Support for the DAI PSM (||<https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/module-psm/>||) module. This is a contract that allows to swap a token into DAI at a fixed rate without fee (or really really tiny), concretelly there is one for USDC, that mean 1 USDC = 1 DAI and 1 DAI = 1 USDC.~~\n  ~~This would help consolidate stable coins together, currently if you have some USDC and the price on the DAI pool is better by 0.03%, it's still better for you to use the USDC pool as you have a 0.05% fee going from USDC into DAI, this allows 0% fee from USDC into DAI and the same in the other dirrection.~~\n  Actually this might be less interresting as I've understood it. There is a 0.1% fee which is more than the 0.05% of uniswap. There is no price impact tho",

Even if that were true the headline reported by the news and the optics of this whole thing definitely had a negative impact on the price of uni tokens. Just the simple fact of how all this looks makes uniswap and its dao look at the very least suspicious and untrustworthy which is not good for the project or it’s investors. This could have been a good thing and may still be but how this was handled was not. I’m not sure what needs to be changed but whatever this process was did not work.",

Am I going about this the right way? Is there an on-chain way to perform my task that I am missing? ( I have asked over 5 times in the #💻dev-chat channel without receiving any response....)\n\n2. If the only way to query uniV3 is through TheGraph... how does Uniswap DAO justify its data being only queryable through a paid / gated service? This sounds to be quite against the \"open-source\", \"blockchain open data\" philosophy...\n\n3. How are other DAOs actively supporting this new, gated, single point of failure that TheGraph is?\n\n4. I know and understand there are costs involved in maintaining this infrastructure, everyone knew this when TheGraph started and positioned itself as the \"single-source-of-truth\" for many queries... Is this now a matter of TheGraph leveraging their unique position in expense of the developers? Why aren't DAOs taking the brunt of the costs ~~and instead participate in the fees collected?~~ How does this make sense in an industry that so severely lacks application development?",

   "Content": "Hello, I'd like to raise awareness on a topic I believe is to Uniswap's benefit to weigh in. TheGraph protocol is charging from the first query, effectively raising a paywall on their new system. That is hampering developer adoption and does it in quite a self-serving way as the unit of payment for the service is the GRT token. I know Uniswap has invested significant resources and given grants for its subgraph to be created, much like other DeFi protocols have done. For a more in-depth analysis of the case, have a look at this thread: https://forum.thegraph.com/t/why-is-there-billing-from-the-first-query/2233/",

   "Content": "Hi everyone, I have a couple noob questions about governance on Uniswap:\n\n1. When I go to the Uniswap governance portal at https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote, I only see 7 proposals. Does this mean there have only been 7 proposals that made it to an official vote in the history of Uniswap? If not, how can I see the full list of proposals that made it to an official vote? \n\n(I've also looked at the proposals at https://gov.uniswap.org/ and https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap but my understanding is that these do not represent binding votes. I read this first: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/community-governance-process/7732)\n\n2. Does the list at https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote represent binding proposal votes for both v3 and v2, or does it represent binding proposals for v2 only? If v3 proposals are separate, is there somewhere I can find a list of binding proposals that have been put to a vote for v3? \n\n3. Was a successful governance vote required in order to deploy Uniswap on Optimism? \n- If so, can anyone share a link to the proposal and vote results to help me better understand the process?\n- If not - and the Uniswap team can deploy to L2s or other chains without a governance vote having to take place - would there be no point for community members to start an official vote to deploy Uniswap on other L2s/chains like Arbitrum/Polygon? \n\nEven if deployments to other chains are not bound by governance, it seems like the community could still get the attention of the Uniswap team to suggest these things via Temperature and Consensus Checks. Please let me know if I'm on the right track here.",

In your proposal you submit what actions you want to do and if it passes those are automatically executed.\n3. It didn't need a proposal because Temp Check had such a huge vote in favor team decided to do it themselves.\n\nThese are brief answers but I hope they help you",

You must not make money right now, because else people will want to know how much and realise that you suck.\nWhat you do is that this startup phase you are a precious gem, and you are able to keep a high price, not with current revenues, but with a promise of even bigger future ones.\nIf UNI's price is that big right now, it's not because it has great benefits (the governance sits doing nothing most of the time and most of the rest of the time it's boring stuff, almost no one owns UNI because of only the governance), but because it promise way bigger benefits in the future (with a fee switch when uniswap does the trade volume of NYC Stock exchange for example).\n\nIf we enable fee switch right now it's possible that the market will start to see UNI not as a great future anymore but as a present that is pretty lame (0.4% APR is bad, and so would see the price crashing to a level where the APR is mostly alligned with the rest of the market).",

I have made a Uni Gov post + Medium Article to propose a DHSM (Diamond Hands Staking Model). \n\nIt is the best tokenomics in the game. I believe UNI can benefit from using it if we use it to distribute UNI rewards.\n\nWe can distribute them via Mining rewards in the next proposal or from the LP rewards if we turn the Protocol Fee switch on\n\n\nPlease have a read and comment I am welcome to all. \n\nThe current issue is that many big DeFi whales, UNI holders included, keep voting NO to do any mining programs. They are protecting their bag because they do not want to grow. \n\nWe need to use this DHSM (Diamond Hands Staking Model) to reward long-term UNI believers.\n\n**The reason why the big whales hate the mining programs is because they just give out rewards to vulture dumpers. But with my model, you can distribute the rewards to people who commit to locking up UNI long-term. They get more rewards than those short-term. **\n\nAnd people who exit early, pay an emergency stake and the rewards go to the believers (50% Treasury, 50% Believers)\n\nThanks for all commentary I am just trying to make us move forward in an optimal way... All information is in my post + medium article :uniswap:",

Timelock address has Governance address as its admin. The current recipient address of the Vester contract can change the recipient via `setRecipient` function. And since Timelock is the current recipient, and it's controlled by Governance, it means that Governance can change the recipient to a new address.\n\nWhen you say \"malicious proposal\", it becomes more philosophical. For example, assuming the contracts have not been exploitable, and someone proposes that the recipient be changed to, say, the burn address, and the current holders of UNIs actually vote for that proposal, then yeah sure the vested UNIs will then start getting burned. Whether this is considered \"malicious\" or not, that's in the eye of the beholder (or UNIholder) 😛",

   "Content": "Hi @yj is there an active treasury management committee within Uniswap?\n\nI was going through this article recently https://uncommoncore.co/a-new-mental-model-for-defi-treasuries/ and had a couple of questions regarding how the Uniswap treasury is being managed currently and its expenditure etc? \n\nMy main questions are:\n1. As per OpenOrgs (https://openorgs.info/), Uniswap currently has $3.6 billion of UNI tokens in the treasury. Where can I find the the monthly expenditure of the treasury?\n2. I know Uniswap Labs & Uniswap protocol are different, so is Uniswap protocol treasury used to fund Uniswap labs operations or is done separately from VC funding etc?\n\nI'm planning to raise a discussion thread on treasury management in the Uniswap governance forum and so wanted to understand the basics of Uniswap treasury before doing that.\n\nThanks",

   "Content": "Hi,\ndoes anyone have more information on how governance works on layer 2?\nAs far as I know, there is only a governance system on L1 -> Governance calls need to take a bridge to L2.\n\nI did some research:\nFor **Polygon**, they use **Fx-Portal:** Seems to be used to relay governance calls from mainnet to the UniswapV3 contracts on Polygon:\n-> See Fx-Portal Contracts: https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8a1b966ac46f42275860f905dbc75efbfdc12374#readContract\n-> `l1Owner` is set to the Uniswap `Timelock` (Ethereum mainnet) contract (i.e., L1 governance system).\n-> The `UniswapV3Factory` contract on Polygon has set its `owner` to this `Fx-Portal EthereumProxy` contract.\nSo it looks like you can bridge governance calls from Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon via this `Fx-Portal `contracts, which will be recognized as `owner` by the UniswapV3 contracts on Polygon.\n\nHowever, I am not sure how it will work for **Arbitrum** and **Optimism**:\nUniswapV3Factory contract on Arbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984#readContract\n-> `Owner` is set to the same address as the Ethereum Mainnet (L1) `Timelock` contract\nHowever, all owner-checks in `UniswapV3Factory` are still written in the form `require(msg.sender == owner);`\nBut the Arbitrum documentation mentions that this will not work? (Quote: \"`msg.sender` — will not simply be the address of the contract on L1 that initiated the message; rather it will be the contract's \"L2 Alias.\", https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#address-aliasing)\n\nDoes Uniswap's implementation with `require(msg.sender == owner);` work on Arbitrum and Optimism? I.e., is there a bridge so that the L1 Timelock contract can create a transaction that, after being passed from L1=>L2, is recognized as coming from the L1 owner address (Ethereum Mainnet Timelock contract)?\n\nWould be great if someone here could share some insights. The process and architecture do not seem to be documented at the moment.",

But as far as I know this is not enforced through smart contracts, and the tokens appear to be fully liquid. I think the only vesting schedule transparently implemented on-chain is the one for the community treasury.\n\nI am not entirely sure what you mean by \"community allocations.\" But from a technical perspective: UNI tokens of the \"community treasury\" are not delegated right now. You can look up the UNI token contract on Etherscan to see that there is no delegate set for the Timelock contract address (owner of the community-treasury allocated UNI Tokens). Hence these tokens cannot be used for governance/voting purposes.",

I was wondering if the community knows if this solution was discussed further on maybe a different forum? I’m super curious to know the impermanent loss impacts to liquidity providers on this buyback-ish program.",

Who can I best reach out to in this server? It can also be someone who is very active in here, it doesn't have to be one of the founders necessarily. Thanks in advance and have a nice day!",

We've already launched our testnet, and giving an additional 100K Kava for projects who deploy early on testnet before May.  \n\nWe'd love for Uniswap to deploy on Kava and not only earn a bulk of the rewards, but build a strong and enduring partnership.\n\nAny interest in setting up a chat with your & our team?\n\nTommy",
