note that when swapping FoT tokens, it's required that you specify only an exact _input_, not _output_. additionally, please ensure that you set a slippage tolerance high enough to compensate for whatever fee the token extracts. for example, if a token takes a 1% fee on transfer, ensure your slippage is ~1.5% or so.","","👍 (8)"

"730463593711140956","BOR4#8524","17-Aug-21 03:32 PM","Hi all! Flipside Crypto’s Uniswap proposal to leverage a $25 million grant to generate 30% yield and fund Uniswap Community-Enabled Analytics is now live!

The most important things to know about the proposal are:

    .    It will be guided first and foremost by a “No Negative Net UNI” ethos, whereby the full initial grant amount is maintained
    .    The generated yield will be transformed into bounties directing analysts to produce insights and interactive solutions for the Uniswap community. That includes offerings like the Uniswap V3 Fee Calculator, a result of  initial UGP pilot - uniswapv3.flipsidecrypto.com
    .    The grant structure includes both Allocation and Oversight Committees to provide checks and balances throughout this process. Oversight Committee members are Nic Carter, Dave Balter and Boris Stanic. There will also be an Allocation Committee, which includes Will Price and Nathan Howard, as well as two members from University Blockchain Groups [announced after the vote to not steer outcomes!]

You can find more info and vote below. You can discuss the proposal in the #❌up6-community-enabled-analytics . Make sure you cast your vote to make sure your voice is heard and help Flipside Crypto assist Uniswap governance at this major moment!
