   "Content": "Hi all! Flipside Crypto’s Uniswap proposal to leverage a $25 million grant to generate 30% yield and fund Uniswap Community-Enabled Analytics is now live!\n\nThe most important things to know about the proposal are:\n\n    .    It will be guided first and foremost by a “No Negative Net UNI” ethos, whereby the full initial grant amount is maintained\n    .    The generated yield will be transformed into bounties directing analysts to produce insights and interactive solutions for the Uniswap community. That includes offerings like the Uniswap V3 Fee Calculator, a result of  initial UGP pilot - uniswapv3.flipsidecrypto.com\n    .    The grant structure includes both Allocation and Oversight Committees to provide checks and balances throughout this process. Oversight Committee members are Nic Carter, Dave Balter and Boris Stanic. There will also be an Allocation Committee, which includes Will Price and Nathan Howard, as well as two members from University Blockchain Groups [announced after the vote to not steer outcomes!]\n\nYou can find more info and vote below. You can discuss the proposal in the #❌up6-community-enabled-analytics . Make sure you cast your vote to make sure your voice is heard and help Flipside Crypto assist Uniswap governance at this major moment!\n\nhttps://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/1/2",
