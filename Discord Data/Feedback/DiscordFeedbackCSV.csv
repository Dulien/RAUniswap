"645829022323966002","leena#4107","01-Dec-19 12:35 AM","@haydenadams the CLP formula used by THORChain does not imply higher swap fees. Fees paid for users are proportional to demand for liquidity, no matter the transaction size or pool depth. As demand for liquidity drops the fee also drops to zero. UniSwap has been found to track reference price within 30 basis points (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03380.pdf) which is a function of the liquidity fee. The CLP formula will ensure that pools over time asymptote to exact market price since they don't have this limitation. 

Additionally, the CLP formula prevents sandwich attacks since it becomes prohibitively expensive to attack a pool. The attacker must make a choice between a slow attack with low fees which opens them up to arbitrage exposure, or a fast attack and pay high fees. 

This characteristic also allows pools to emit trustless price feeds that are resistant to manipulation. It is known that a sandwich attack on a UniSwap pool costs no more than 60 basis points (https://github.com/Uniswap/contracts-vyper/issues/31) which is the reason why it can't really be used as a price feed. UniSwap V2 hopes to generate a TWAP based on snapshotted prices over a period of time, however depending on implementation this may cause runaway state growth and does not mean resistance to sandwich attacks, since an attacker can sandwich attack at the exact time of the snapshot. 

I can help you through any other conceptual understandings around the CLP formula.","",""

How do the Uniswap V2 oracles work? A TWAP requires historical pricing, which means state needs to be stored. Ideally the state is purged after a period of time if it is no longer needed. How does a price snapshot avoid sandwich attacks if the price snapshot blockheight is known ahead of time?

Uniswap tracks reference price within a margin of 30 basis points because that is the liquidity fee. A CLP price feed should track the exact reference price since arbitrage trades can become smaller and smaller as the price stabilises. There is no upper or lower limit to the CLP fee. 

The average trade size (DAI<>ETH)  on Uniswap appears to be around ~$1000 over $1m+ in liquidity, so 30 basis points would exceed the 10 basis points charged by the CLP method. 

The point of the CLP formula is not to bias the fee model to either the Staker or Swapper, it simply ensures the fee paid always matches the demand for a pool's liquidity, no matter the size of the pool or transaction.","",""

@haydenadams I'm quite fascinated by what you just said. Do you mind sharing with me how it works? 

With the CLP design, 5 swaps of $10 will always pay less in fees than 1 swap of $50. Since at any point, a $10 swap has less ""demand for liquidity"" than a $50 swap, and the relationship isn't linear. The $10 swapper is more patient than the $50 swapper. However with a limited block space this now adds a time imperative into the decision-making process of a swapper. The adage ""money always moves from the impatient to the patient"" is true here. 

In the context that there is a lucrative arbitrage opportunity and that a swapper has factored in the profit margin (after the CLP fee the trade is still profitable), then the system will capture more in fees to liquidity providers.","",""

First thing I noticed when I booted into Linux (I have 2 OS on my pc) that I have been able to use uniswap on it so it must be something with windows I thought.
And guess what? It was!

I have realised that my pc (windows) started to show the wrong time for some odd reason. It was two hours early even tho it was in the right time zone and automatic time set is on. So I decided to turn off and then on that setting in hope it would refresh itself and eliminate the bug which was successful.
Then I suddenly remembered that infamous Y2020 bug which has caused many systems to fail when we've entered the year 2020.
I immediately knew that was the problem so I went back to Uniswap with the correct machine time this time and VOILA! It works!

What caused my pc to be set back in time tho I have 0 idea. I have also no idea why would that be a problem for Uniswap.","","üòÜ (1)"

Also a suggestion:
When I wanted to pool eth/usdc I first swapped some usdc for eth and speed up the transactions.
The speed up Tx's got approved, but when I wanted to join pool I got the message 'approving usdc...'
The problem wasn't clear to me and I had to put some effort into it. 
I solved it by going to the right above and click a button (not sure what it exactly said, something like pending, but these were the first transactions) and then click remove tx or something. This is quite cumbersome, maybe a '?' button with an explanation is a good idea.","",""

This was partly due to the good ROI that investors were experiencing. However, in the last few weeks, we have noticed that the returns across almost all coins have gotten reduced.  There could be  alot of reasons for it for instance users subscribing to alert services lately. However, there is one aspect where Uniswap can actually improve which is not let front-running bots forcebily make their way to be the first entry right after the coin gets liquidity. Take for example this twitter post that was made yesterday. The bot made its way to be the first (by spamming the network?), bought a whole bunch of coins and then dumped it on retail investors buying afterwards. Can you please take a look at this issue?

Especially when there is some unusual price action (big buys / sells) and I want to take advantage of it, it seems Uniswap changs the route e.g. from USDT -> Token to USD -> WETH -> Token in the very last moment (after I transmitted the transaction to Metamask) and then my transactions fail due to 'out of gas'.

Lost already so many $$$ to it.

Uniswap liquidity providers have not yet worried about the bear market which can have price drops of over 80%. Uniswap also hasn‚Äôt yet gone through 1 bear market as well. What I worry about is that in a bear market, users will not be willing to buy Eth and a token pair to provide liquidity to uniswap if they think the prices will be dropping in the future. The way to tackle this can be to provide a way for users to unlock liquidity similar to what stafi protocol or ramp defi are doing with staking- since tokens get locked in staking they are coming up with a solution to get equivalent rtokens that they can still trade to avoid users worry about price fluctuation. Perhaps you can partner with stafi or ramp defi or someone else that can help you unlock liquidity by giving univ2 tokens that users can still trade on uniswap platform. In that way, users can still provide liquidity in a bear market without worrying about future price decrease. Also right now we have several months or year/s to think about this or implement this. But you should really take it seriously. I don‚Äôt wanna buy Ethereum and a token and provide liquidity to uniswap if I think a bear market is upcoming and prices will drop drastically. Liquidity earnings are very small compared to price drops that can be experienced by both Eth and tokens","",""

I understand that people were sending crypto to wrong addresses.. But the problem with having it in expert mode is that we also lose the transaction confirmation page.

Normally I hit swap.. and then the next step shows me the transaction details that include the recipient I added. Double-checking the recipient before sending the crypto is essential to me because one mistake and you lose everything.

Can we still have the transaction detail confirmation page if we add a recipient? Because expert mode takes that away. So now it's even more dangerous.

One thing that I sadly though either misunderstood or where I'd wish it was easier to aget information / maybe a small hint that funds can be lost is -- liquidity pools. I did read about how they work and my impression was that IL just applied to unrealized profit, and that since the value in the vault should stay the same, the value in the vault stays the same. Yet I experienced today that i had less value when exiting the pool than when entering. The entirer concept of IL is highly confusing and many people doon't realize that they can lose a good portion of their funds when joining a LP. Actually given how they 'should' work it's still not quite clear to me. Because iiirc one of the fundamentals of a LP is that the value inside is constant, hence should people sell one asset in favor of ETH more of that asset is being added and some eth taken out, but not changing the overall value for the LP. Well my experience was quite different (and no, i provided a high mc coin + eth , so not a scamtoken or such_ Thanks.","",""

Unfortunately, the best solution is for Ethereum to be scalable which could possibly happen after Ethereum 2.0 which is far away out. Currently, different projects are trying different things to cope with high Ethereum gas fees- creating projects on complementing blockchains like Binance Smart Chain or Tron. Also, some projects are trying to group transactions to reduce gas costs. All of the above haven‚Äôt shown much promise though. Binance Smart Chain or Tron did not attract the same kind of following that Uniswap did. It could be partly due to the fact that Uniswap team is very competent and have a created a modern UI with a new pricing engine for trading. I think the best thing would be if Uniswap tried to implement Uniswap product on another blockchain like Polkadot etc. if you guys can keep the UI modern and simple just like it is right now then I‚Äôm pretty sure users will start using it way more happily than they are currently doing for Binance Smart Chain or Tron. Have you guys thought about implementing something like that?  That could be the best possible answer to high Eth gas fees for the current industry. Other projects don‚Äôt match Uniswap competency and capability to create something great like Uniswap on another blockchain. Can you guys take on that challenge? Thanks","",""

The problem with this type of arbitrage is that swappers are never routed by the front end (until they swap exact token to token) to pairs without WETH, DAI, USDC, USDT, MKR, and COMP.

This often leaves pairs with high liquidity without these six tokens out of sync with the actual prices, and this is where the bots are taking advantage. For now, this problem is in the early stage, but as is my understanding, this can be a critical thing in the future, and everyone is forced to add liquidity only with pairs containing WETH, DAI, USDC, USDT, MKR and COMP...

The bots are just one consequence of this issue, and they're always R&D how to improve themselves day by day. I talked with many members from the DFOhub and other communities that are constantly sending me upgrades of this thing.

So the article works as an advice for communities to avoid the issue and for the Uniswap team to consider that this is a real problem which is growing and, if possible, do something about it.","","üëç (1)"

I have a feedback/suggestion into boosting UNI price. Uniswap has become a popular exchange. I think we can use it as a portal for new projects like Binance is doing. So basically, the way it works is that for a new project you advertise them on Uniswap and users stake UNI tokens to get rewarded in the new project's tokens. The new project give you a pool of tokens. Basically staking UNI tokens to yield farm the new project tokens (Example: https://launchpad.binance.com/en/lottery/15954e22173249078a1d5bb3a3ebe606).

What we have seen in yield farming projects is that these APY rewards demolish the price since users keep on cashing out on the rewards. There is not even 1 yield farming project that has seen a sustainable price increase. If possible, please end the UNI rewards program a little early if it continues to impose sell pressure on price. When in doubt just look at what Binance is doing (via their website). All there strategies boost there BNB token's price (they yield farm other project's token while staking their own. So the sell pressure via cashing rewards is on the other token).","",""

     - dev-general (or something 
        similar) 
     - oracles
     - subgraph 

That way we keep a distinction between the general discussion and the developer side of the Discord.","","üëç (1)"

I would be a little hesitant to push too much new information through popups/banners within the app (see the uproar on token list updates) because most people who use Uniswap are not UNI governance participants. But I do think an indicator in the header (an unread dot for instance) could be a subtle way to prompt people to check that tab. 

Another option is to query on whether the wallet holds UNI to show or hide some popups when a new proposal is active, but again my hunch is that most folks would find it annoying except the most hardcore governance users :)

On thing I'm excited to see is the progress of project like https://www.boardroom.info/ and https://withtally.com/ for the more governance intensive tools. Similar to how the Uniswap app is the minimum viable product and more complex interactions that serve a smaller but more pro userbase are built externally like http://uniswaproi.com","",""

Just wondering, for tax purposes, when you provide liquidity and get LP tokens (as far as I understand it, this is considered selling 2 coins and purchasing an LP token)
in terms of tracking the LP tokens, why are they always just named ""uni-v2""?
So in my tax tracking software, I need to manually manage which tokens follow which coin pairs and its fine as I've only provided for 1 pair so far, but if I had 50 different LP tokens all called uni-v2 it'd be crazy annoying
Would it be possible to have all the Lp tokens have an actual name, even if its just uni v2 usdteth for example","",""

Only the holder of LP tokens can withdraw the deposited tokens. The reason why the LP token is NOT named uniquely is because it is the claim on the deposited tokens.  I strongly cautioned you not to recognize the changes to the LP tokens value as income.  Your recognized gain or loss of capital is the difference between the deposited token and the withdrawn (when you burn the LP token), this is a capital gain or loss of the underlying tokens. It is entirely possible that the tokens value goes to zero while in the contract.

And I think your analogy of a deposit slip breaks down because the LP tokens are not tied to a specific amount of tokens (as the ratios may change) and they are not tied to a % of the pool either (as other depositors may enter or leave).

When you enter the pool, you provide things of value (matched tokens) and receive Value1 in LP tokens in return.  When you leave the pool, you return those LP tokens (to be burned), and receive Value2 worth of the two corresponding tokens.

The widget provided in the Uniswap V3 blog article has limited range ($1-$4000 at $1820 ETH/USD price). Is there an easy way to assess Uni V3 capital efficiency compared to Uni V2 on wider ranges? Perhaps there is a sheet you could point me towards?

In particular, I'm interested in how capital efficiency looks for symmetrical positions, and the widget only provides with 0.45-2.2x price range for that.
So something like:
0.5-2x = 3.41x
0.25-4x = ?
0.125-8x = ?

Uniswap has a `0.3%` fee, the high fee you see aren't uniswap fee, they are ETH network fees paid to miners, uniswap is gonna release an L2 solution in hopefully jully, there is also ETH 2.0 that should lower the gas price too.","",""

By limit order I mean picking a price, and putting all liquidity provision concentrated a single tick wide of only a single asset at anything other than the market price. 

It is already possible to manually make a limit order but you have to mess with it to find out the most concentrated it will allow your liquidity to be. Instead of paying the swap fee, you get a maker rebate, and I think this feature will be popular.

This would be a big help, but if you really wanted to support limit orders you could also add a limit order flag that only provides liquidity in one trade direction so that its not possible to have your order reversed by the price moving back across your limit price before you can withdraw the liquidity.","",""

1. Hide pools where both pairs are not available on any common exchanges (or maybe just make a whitelist manually).
2. Hide pools until they have done a certain number of transactions -- at least force the scammers to eat gas fees to become visible.
* In both cases you could let people still find them if they are willing to check a box or etc to ""Show all pools""","",""

"389980440494080010","Marc477#4218","07-May-21 07:01 PM","Uniswap really needs a way to update ranges. It makes no sense at the moment to remove your entire pool to create a new one because of the fees. 
For example if you set a range 3000-6000 first time (eth-usd) and then ETH goes to 3000, you will end up with no more usdc. 
It would be much more smart to be able to add back only usdc since you have much more than enough eth already. 
Doing that would decrease the first range for example adding only usdc would change from 3000-6000 range to 2000-6000.
The top range stays the same since you didnt add ETH. I think this is needed in future versions.","","üëç (3)"

"423192409543802882","dlokman#5019","07-May-21 11:05 PM","2 main things that need to be simplified for V3 mass adoption are as follows:

1) Add Liquidity: Simplify ""Price Range"" section to not be ratios but simple dollar values. Ratios are very confusing for average users. Eg for ETH/LINK pair, Min Value for LINK could be $30 and Max value could be $100 where the user wants to provide liquidity. Current price is $50. Why do we need to specify LINK value in terms of Eth? Why can't the user select that he/she wants to provide liquidity for LINK token between $30 and $100. Simple. This could be just 2 input boxes or a range selection with 2 button sliders.
The ratio logic if needed should be handled by your backend without exposing it to the user

2)Simplify ""Liquidity Distribution"" chart under Pools for a token so the user can quickly read it at first glance. Again  avoid using ratios and plain dollar values for the token. We should be able to look at the chart which should be in eg LINK dollar value where most liquidity is provided. The user should not have to convert anything in his/her head or via a calculator.

We have news articles making fun of V3 that you need a Masters Degree on how to set the Price Range while providing liquidity on V3 : https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-fees-sting-but-uniswap-v3-see-more-volume-on-launch-day-than-v2-s-first-month","","üëè (3)"

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange, it's just a tool to interact directly with contracts easier. Uniswap is never in control of your funds or you transactions like a centralized exchange is. You should stick to centralized exchanges that offer the coins you want if you want more support and lower fees. Most swaps made within centralized exchanges are just numbers being moved on an excel spreadsheet on the backend of the website. The fees are lower because they don't actually have to process a transaction unless you are transferring tokens to an external wallet. Unfortunately with decentralized exchanges you're on your own, but you also have complete control over what you are doing.","",""

Think of Uniswap as a toll freeway for cars. The more people using that freeway, the more congestion there is, this causes strain on the miners that process and record transactions like the two you were sending. They reverted due to some kind of error, likely related to all the other people that were trading FAR more in value. Those people (or other aggregators) will pay higher gas fees in order to be handled by miners first or sooner. You sent those transactions during a time of exceptionally high gas prices.

1) be patient with your eth based trades. In the last week gas has gone from $8 a swap to over $200 and that cycle has been going all of 2021. Check the charts and wait for the gas fee to be 5-10% of what your trading and stop complaining to teams that are not ETH devs

2) Uni v3 is brand new! It's confusing as hell and doesn't have enough use to pull any meaningful metrics to base pros and cons on. Be patient, let it settle, go out side, and chill

3) if you've been in crypto for more than a couple mo ths you should know better than to dive head first into a brand new project without reading every single post by the project, joking ever social media group, and reading the last week or two of comments on all of them.

I really wish there was another ""option"" where I could just set my ETH-[Poo Coin] pool to collect fees regardless of price... infinite range.

Why is this not a thing? Why do I have to suddenly narrow my fee collection down to a band when the poo coin could easily drop to almost nothing in value or alternatively, with the luck of the gods and some hype from a celebrity, go to the moon (and then probably drop again immediately after some FUD).

I wanna be able to create my LP, leave it there forever, and just collect fees on ALL tx's... like apparently I used to.

Why is this now not a thing? Am I missing something? I mean, I'm gonna have to migrate to v3 since charting for v2 is gone.

(EDIT: that is to say, if v3 is designed to replace v2, then I will have to migrate eventuallly. So, should I wait for v4 to be able to just have a pool that covers ALL possible prices?).","",""

"216341510994657280","Adref#5620","21-May-21 09:19 AM","Having, potentially, three different liquidity pools for every different token by different fee structure seems bad, as it lowers liquidity in each separate pool and therefore reduces the utility of uniswap as a market, and means that sometimes there may be some people conducting multiple ETH transactions within uniswap just for arbitrage, which just seems wasteful of gas and blockchain space
Alternative proposal, assuming that it is feasible:

When submitting liquidity, each person votes on what their preferred fee for the pool is, in sensible increments (e.g. of 0.001%) and with some reasonable cap that should probably be a *little* higher than 1% IMO (there are some low volume shitcoins out there).
When a swap transaction is submitted, the actual market maker fee for the swap is calculated as the value-weighted average of the votes of the marginal liquidity at that price point (e.g. someone wants to swap some X for Y. The fee for this, allocated to each ""in range"" share of the pool, would be the sum of each liquidity provider's fee multiplied by their fraction of the volume of the swap txn that will be used). Instead of a straight weighted average, an alternative algorithm could be used such as ignoring values past some number of standard deviations away from the average in either direction to reduce the effect of outlier parties trying to raise the fee too high for example, although this is part of the rationale behind a fee cap mentioned earlier.
There is then a market mechanism to encourage dynamically adjusted fees for the pools as market volatility conditions change; to make the fees affordable enough to be competitive with other swapping services while still being profitable enough to attract liquidity to the pool
Uniswap avoids a situation where FEI/USDC 0.3% and FEI/USDC 1% pools are both in the top 20 by daily volume, as they are currently. Instead there would be a single FEI/USDC swap pool, with a fee that would probably be somewhere between 0.3% and 1%","",""

There is the governance, which is group of UNI holders voting for things, it has powers through the huge number of UNI in his vault.
And the uniswap labs team which made the governance and manage app.uniswap.org and the uniswap trademark.

BTW if you really don't like you can vote to redirect what the UI resolves too. The governance owns `uniswap.eth` and `uniswap.eth` has an IPFS field, you could setup a vote to downgrade it to a lower version, or fork and remove all of that and also the SEC and FCC enforcement if you want.

Average person (99% of your users) have zero idea that you don't really restrict anything and they are causing tons of unfounded FUD across the internet. I will say it only once - if you are afraid of a random government, take down the official interface and link only decentralized `ipfs` versions on your official website with one liner explanation that nothing has been and will never be censored. Or even wrap the interface with electron and advertise it as desktop/mobile app.

- I find it tedious to constantly swap the coins I need before I can put them in the pool I want, and I usually get the ratios wrong... It would be a real nice to have if I could do - ETH/USDC pool eth price: 2000 pool bounds 1500 - 2500 input USDC input 2000 ETH input 0 and then either the app or a contract facilitates the swap before putting the correct amount into the pool. That way I can have put as much as I want into a pool with 1 action and not have to swap a second time because I am bad at math.
- For removing liquidity from a pool, It would be nice to have the option to withdraw my position and choose the allocation of assets. Lets say I am in a pool of USDC/ETH and my position is out of range so my position is 100% USDC. I would like to withdraw my liquidity, but swap it all to ETH so that I can ride the gravy train up the hill!","","üëç (2)"

The first question, you can just open https://info.uniswap.org and https://v2.info.uniswap.org and see that there is plenty of volume and liquidity available.

"838651199221661706","wei3erHase#3269","10-Aug-21 07:52 PM","Hi people, i'm using Solidity 8.4 and discovered that many Uniswap libraries are not compilable with this version because of implicit type casting, for example:
TickMath 25: require(absTick <= uint256(MAX_TICK), 'T');

Since MAX_TICK is a int24, it cannot be transformed directly into uint256, but instead I need to do this:
require(absTick <= uint256(uint24(MAX_TICK)), 'T');

So my questions are the following:
- Should somebody change pragma solidity >=0.5.0; to a more accurate dependency?
- Is there anywhere in the roadmap making Uniswap compatible with newer versions of Solidity?

I don't really know where to post this issue, since I get the feeling they are not being taken into account: https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v3-core/issues/489

I'm forced to copy and paste the libraries into my own repo and make the modifications (that are VERY simple)","",""

"829495717403295784","awbvious#9957","20-Nov-21 04:35 PM","Per the rekt article that just came out: https://rekt.news/uniswap-v3-lp-rekt/

I think there's a very easy, elegant solution to the problem of ""just-in-time (JIT) liquidity.""

First alert developers of this upcoming change.  Give them a month to update their code.  Then for a month or two, create a banner on the swap page:

""We've just introduced a new feature: Just-in-Time Liquidity protection. You can read about it here [medium link].  All existing liquidity will have it, and any new liquidity added through uniswap.org will as well, unless you choose to select Advanced -> Instantly Removable -> On.""

The medium article can read: 

Bots can front-run normal liquidity providers by quickly adding and removing liquidity when they see a large swap is about to occur.  They do this within the same block, so they can prevent ""impermanent loss"" and use very concentrated liquidity settings that will get maximum preference for fees.

Preventing Just-in-time (JIT) liquidity helps everyone but the bots:

- Non-bot users will get more fees as the fees are no longer going to bots
- Uniswap will have more liquidity, as non-bot users by necessity have to provide more liquidity than bots, because non-bot users cannot know when swaps will happen and must spread their assets
- Swappers will have more liquidity at their disposal and thus they will get better rates

From now on, unless a user selects Advanced -> Instantly Removable -> On, their liquidity will not be removable for the duration of 1 block (approximately a few seconds) and will thus be given fee preference to liquidity providers who either: A) provide via the UI with the ""Instantly Removable"" feature ""On"" or B) provide liquidity programmatically without the new optional parameter of instant_liquidity as FALSE.","",""
"829495717403295784","awbvious#9957","20-Nov-21 04:35 PM","Basically, the UI sets the instant_liquidity as FALSE by default, unless a user purposely changes it to ""On""/TRUE.  However, programmatically, the default is set as TRUE unless unless the code purposesly sets it as FALSE.

Again, the instant_liquidity parameter will be TRUE by default going forward, thus those who add programatically using legacy code will still be able to do so, but unless they add this parameter, their liquidity will not be given preference.  Thus legacy code should be updated.  (We reached out to the development community a month ago to prepare them for this change.)

Whatever the instant_liquidy parameter is set during the providing of liquidity, sets the parameter on the liquidity NFT.

As for those who provided liquidity before this change by any means, all existing v3 NFTs before this change have been set as instant_liquidity FALSE.  Thus old holders of liquidity do not have to do anything.  Further, no user would need instant_liquidity as TRUE, as enough time has passed that they can all safely remove liquidity by now.

We hope this will thwart JIT liquidity.  If it proves to not be sufficient to simply give preference to those with instant_liquidity FALSE, then a new fee preference structure may be created where preference is not only determined by the tightness of the liquidity range but also the length of time providing liquidity.  However, we hope/think this will suffice, and will attempt this first.

Thanks.","",""

Do you really think swappers cares ?
I really think that swappers doesn't care, they want low fees, variety of tokens and a protocol they trust.
As long as the swappers gets a good price and swaps goes well, they don't care about how they are done.

I'm gonna stop arguing because I belive that we don't agree on basic things :
- At equal everything else swappers wants low prices (so on the same network, same coins, same ease of use, ... over time swappers will use the cheapest service).
- And on web3 you can't stop innovation.

If someone find a way to propose better prices and you don't use that, you are just loosing customers.

You can't just decide that you don't like JIT or that it's unfair, if you do so you make price worst and will loose swappers.","",""

Thus, they can't do such a super-narrow liquidity range.  Or.   B) Rather than play cat and mouse trying to figure out the optimal amount of time, again, create a v4 which is the same as v3 except the longer you keep assets in your v3 positions the more you can ""transfer"" to the v3 that is currently being used for a swap.  E.g. Alice and Bob have got two pools ETH/USDC and WBTC/USDT, $50 in each, and Alice has had them for 10 days while for Bob has had them for 20 days.  Alice and Bob are the only liquidity holders fro WBTC/USDT.  A trade is going to happen on WBTC/USDT.  At the best rates possible, with zero fees, for each, some ETH and USDC is traded for WBTC and USDT (maybe the ETH goes through the ETH/WBTC pool and the USDC goes through the USDC/USDT pool).  Since Alice was holding for half the time of the other liquidity holder, $50 of ETH/USDC is added to her WBTC/USDT pool, making it now $150 in size.  For Bob, all $100 is transferred, making it $200 in size.  The trade goes through, and then, with zero fees, the WBTC/USDT goes back to ETH/USDC pool.  Now, let's say there's Charles, he's got $100 ETH/USDC and nothing in WBTC/USDT.  He sees in the mempool that a transactions coming, so he put in $100 WBTC/USDT.  Well, nearly none of his ETH/USDC will move over since it's been less than a second since he added to WBTC/USDT (time of holding can be determined by whichever is most recent, either the recipient or the sender, in such a liquidity transfer), which is barely anything compared to 10 days or 20 days.","",""

""Swap and Add
The new router contract now offers an atomic ‚Äòswap-and-add‚Äô function that makes it possible to provide liquidity with only one of the asset‚Äôs in the pool, or any ratio of the two assets.

In order to add liquidity to a Uniswap v3 pool, the user or contract must provide two assets in a particular ratio. In many cases, the user only holds a single asset or an arbitrary ratio of the two assets. This means you often have some tokens left over after adding liquidity. A simple approach is to submit a swap transaction to reach the optimal ratio and then submit an add liquidity transaction -- but your swap (and other transactions in between) will have changed the optimal ratio!

The new SwapRouter makes it possible to swap and then add liquidity in a single atomic transaction. The smart-order-router npm package even includes a function to compute the optimal ratio and transaction calldata. Check out this new developer guide to learn how to swap-and-add in your project today.""","",""

I got the hint that to increase stability, efficiency in pools swap and of course, fees would only be capable if there was no auto-compound and you had to harvest your own words pro-actively.
I did some basic math and was wondering if the utility and economic benefit of v3 will offset the losses from not being able to harvest your trades daily due to gas costs.
If you receive a 40% APR on a $5,000 investment, you'll make $2,000 w/o compounding and assuming your (r) holds.  If you were compounding daily, you would return an APY% of 49.15 and earn an additional $457 on your trade.  Assume all of it gets reinvested.
If you took a modest gas fee of $25,  (mine 1hr ago EST) in v3 to harvest $5.40 was $70.00, you would lose your entire profit by the ~18th time you selected to compound during the year.
I'm not tech-savvy.  Please let me know how this helps the long position in the LP.  I'm going to assume if Uniswap doesn't put a lot of literature out for the amateurs (learning in progress) - people are going to panic.  Really, any new asset manager, bank, pension, endowment, insurance co, and or corporate who are making big pushes to tell their bosses how this could make sense w/o massaging a white paper.   They gripe when their cash balances are off by 5bps.","","üëçüèª (1)"

You can go through the math behind it in detail, but imo more important difference between uniV3 and V2 is the higher capital efficacy due to smaller trading range that comes on the other hand with the drawback that you have to decide which kind of range you like to choose. While V2 was a 'put in and forget' game V3 needs more care. And ofc both protocols still have their value in a balanced portfolio. btw, I still have liquidity in uniV1;-)","",""

"244849478371246080","Philogy#8073","28-Feb-22 12:55 PM","I've been using the Uniswap V3 UI and have some feedback I'd like to share on my experience:
- the UI is generally slow to update when changing different values and feels a little clunky
- lacks information like new position virtual liquidity vs pool liquidity at different prices i.e. fee share. As a LP I'd really like to know what percentage of fees I'll earn in the different price zones
- price range input is quite inaccurate, the percentage of the price boundaries changes based on zoom level despite the value price boundaries remaining the same
- token conversion rates are truncated at relatively low digit counts making it cumbersome to use with tokens which have a very small / large prices relative to each other (<1.0e-5 or >1.0e+6 )
- lack of ""reinvest button"" for individual positions: seeing as the NFT Liquidity Position Manager implements a `multicall` method it'd be really cool to be able to leverage that directly in the UI and combine different operations such as withdrawing fees and depositing them into your position or even withdrawing from multiple positions in a single transaction

Please don't take this feedback the wrong way, I really think V3 is cool and the UI despite its flaws is great. As a smart contract and frontend dev myself I understand how hard it can be to integrate everything, I can't wait to see how you improve the frontend in the future. Do you guys maybe have a recommendation for other frontends I could use to manage V3 LP positions?","","üôè (3)"

1. Open Uniswap on more chains.  suggest $TLOS $XDC $CSPR $DOT and $AVAX - These chains are faster, cheaper, and more scaleable than ETH and MATIC. Be a first mover and reap the rewards of those communities using your DEX. The more chains UNI is on the better for UNI and customers because they know what they are getting and they know it will be secure. It allows UNI to be the goto DEX on all the chains.

2. After UNI is solidified on more chains there are more options to further enhance UNISWAP interoperability between chains. A partnership with Celsius Network would allow for secure bridging between chains. For example if you had liquidity pairs that were the same on multiple chains say ETH, MATIC, and TLOS a partnership with CelsiusX could pull liquidity from one chain and bridge liquidity where it is needed most on another. This would make Uniswap an unstoppable awesome multi-chain DEX that no other Dex has been able to do yet. It also allows for liquidity and assets to flow where they are best treated if a chain is experiencing high demand and high gas a user could opt to do their exchange on another chain and the liquidity if needed could flow where it is best treated and used. Users and Liquidity providers would all benefit because their assets would not be stove-piped on one chain.

3. Uni governance could implement a small fee or a range of possible fees so as not to harm liquidity providers from all transactions across all chains paid out to UNI holders. This would increase value of UNI and pay holders to continue to hold it. It would incentivize LPs to also hold UNI so as to benefit from that fee. These Fees could all be converted in bulk from native transaction currencies to UNI once a month and distributed out to UNI token holders like a dividend.","",""

The main things going for ETH is the amount of development that has already happened on the network. Although most new builds are going to other chains/networks now. if/when it shifts to POS fees should come down drastically to probably less than $5 a transaction (still not great compared to others but a major improvement to ETH). Finally ETH will become deflationary which if demand remains should be good for ETH price.

After a Celsius X partnership you can create a new terms and conditions and have a checkbox for users creating liquidity to choose this chain only or crosschain/multi-chain LP. Meaning you can earn fees with your liquidity on any chain and claim on any chain. This Would CRUSH any other DEX out there.
