Currently, liquidity providers lose when prices move in one direction (such as a trend that is starting about now) as we all know.  I suggest, making the fee variable.

This way, people won't shy away from depositing since they won't lose their money.",

Also they have quite an impressive grand vision of what the capabilities of their system could eventually be. See https://github.com/thorchain/Resources/blob/master/Whitepapers/ASGARDEX/whitepaper-en.md for an example. It sounds like this was dreamed up partly for a hackathon for binance dex in May of last year. The mind behind it may have been sniped by binance but I don't really know.

   "Content": "@haydenadams the CLP formula used by THORChain does not imply higher swap fees. Fees paid for users are proportional to demand for liquidity, no matter the transaction size or pool depth. As demand for liquidity drops the fee also drops to zero. UniSwap has been found to track reference price within 30 basis points (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03380.pdf) which is a function of the liquidity fee. The CLP formula will ensure that pools over time asymptote to exact market price since they don't have this limitation. \n\nAdditionally, the CLP formula prevents sandwich attacks since it becomes prohibitively expensive to attack a pool. The attacker must make a choice between a slow attack with low fees which opens them up to arbitrage exposure, or a fast attack and pay high fees. \n\nThis characteristic also allows pools to emit trustless price feeds that are resistant to manipulation. It is known that a sandwich attack on a UniSwap pool costs no more than 60 basis points (https://github.com/Uniswap/contracts-vyper/issues/31) which is the reason why it can't really be used as a price feed. UniSwap V2 hopes to generate a TWAP based on snapshotted prices over a period of time, however depending on implementation this may cause runaway state growth and does not mean resistance to sandwich attacks, since an attacker can sandwich attack at the exact time of the snapshot. \n\nI can help you through any other conceptual understandings around the CLP formula.",

I was tagged to check out this thread by someone else in the community. \n\nHow do the Uniswap V2 oracles work? A TWAP requires historical pricing, which means state needs to be stored. Ideally the state is purged after a period of time if it is no longer needed. How does a price snapshot avoid sandwich attacks if the price snapshot blockheight is known ahead of time?\n\nUniswap tracks reference price within a margin of 30 basis points because that is the liquidity fee. A CLP price feed should track the exact reference price since arbitrage trades can become smaller and smaller as the price stabilises. There is no upper or lower limit to the CLP fee. \n\nThe average trade size (DAI<>ETH)  on Uniswap appears to be around ~$1000 over $1m+ in liquidity, so 30 basis points would exceed the 10 basis points charged by the CLP method. \n\nThe point of the CLP formula is not to bias the fee model to either the Staker or Swapper, it simply ensures the fee paid always matches the demand for a pool's liquidity, no matter the size of the pool or transaction.",

Do you mind sharing with me how it works? \n\nWith the CLP design, 5 swaps of $10 will always pay less in fees than 1 swap of $50. Since at any point, a $10 swap has less \"demand for liquidity\" than a $50 swap, and the relationship isn't linear. The $10 swapper is more patient than the $50 swapper. However with a limited block space this now adds a time imperative into the decision-making process of a swapper. The adage \"money always moves from the impatient to the patient\" is true here. \n\nIn the context that there is a lucrative arbitrage opportunity and that a swapper has factored in the profit margin (after the CLP fee the trade is still profitable), then the system will capture more in fees to liquidity providers.",

It was!\n\nI have realised that my pc (windows) started to show the wrong time for some odd reason. It was two hours early even tho it was in the right time zone and automatic time set is on. So I decided to turn off and then on that setting in hope it would refresh itself and eliminate the bug which was successful.\nThen I suddenly remembered that infamous Y2020 bug which has caused many systems to fail when we've entered the year 2020.\nI immediately knew that was the problem so I went back to Uniswap with the correct machine time this time and VOILA! It works!\n\nWhat caused my pc to be set back in time tho I have 0 idea. I have also no idea why would that be a problem for Uniswap.",

One cosmetic change I would recommend, that just hurts me to see, is listing pairs as \"WETH\" instead of ETH. I understand that's part of the background improvements, but seeing as there's no WETH/ETH pair, and I don't think you ahve to worry about any legality of it, I'd just label them as ETH. WETH is ETH anyway. \n\nI'd be interested to know if this is a bad idea. But if we're all working towards long term adoption of all this stuff, the capital W is just one more question mark for newbies that would discourage them upon first seeing something like this.",

Though the fee is to avoid any scams in the network, it would be helpful if there's some other way of doing it. Like, as a user who uses ethereum primarily, getting to install a multicoin wallet and buying crypto for it just to pay for my PR to get processed seems little overwhelming. It would be really helpful if uniswap has any alternative methods of doing it :) Just a user's opinion here.",

   "Content": "Uniswap has gotten pretty popular with retail investors in the last few months. This was partly due to the good ROI that investors were experiencing. However, in the last few weeks, we have noticed that the returns across almost all coins have gotten reduced.  There could be  alot of reasons for it for instance users subscribing to alert services lately. However, there is one aspect where Uniswap can actually improve which is not let front-running bots forcebily make their way to be the first entry right after the coin gets liquidity. Take for example this twitter post that was made yesterday. The bot made its way to be the first (by spamming the network?), bought a whole bunch of coins and then dumped it on retail investors buying afterwards. Can you please take a look at this issue? \nhttps://twitter.com/rstormsf/status/1282734073081823232",

   "Content": "Hello, I‚Äôm a little worried about Uniswap. Uniswap started around nov 2018- almost at the start of the bull market. Uniswap liquidity providers have not yet worried about the bear market which can have price drops of over 80%. Uniswap also hasn‚Äôt yet gone through 1 bear market as well. What I worry about is that in a bear market, users will not be willing to buy Eth and a token pair to provide liquidity to uniswap if they think the prices will be dropping in the future. The way to tackle this can be to provide a way for users to unlock liquidity similar to what stafi protocol or ramp defi are doing with staking- since tokens get locked in staking they are coming up with a solution to get equivalent rtokens that they can still trade to avoid users worry about price fluctuation. Perhaps you can partner with stafi or ramp defi or someone else that can help you unlock liquidity by giving univ2 tokens that users can still trade on uniswap platform. In that way, users can still provide liquidity in a bear market without worrying about future price decrease. Also right now we have several months or year/s to think about this or implement this. But you should really take it seriously. I don‚Äôt wanna buy Ethereum and a token and provide liquidity to uniswap if I think a bear market is upcoming and prices will drop drastically. Liquidity earnings are very small compared to price drops that can be experienced by both Eth and tokens",

But the problem with having it in expert mode is that we also lose the transaction confirmation page.\n\nNormally I hit swap.. and then the next step shows me the transaction details that include the recipient I added. Double-checking the recipient before sending the crypto is essential to me because one mistake and you lose everything.\n\nCan we still have the transaction detail confirmation page if we add a recipient? Because expert mode takes that away. So now it's even more dangerous.\n\nThank you",

It's just so much easier to be able to find a contract address and drop it right into Uniswap, find the token, add it, and then continue on. I think segregated lists, while perhaps a nice external site, or opt-in functionality as others have mentioned, reduce the seamless experience Uniswap offers, and breaks some of the quick flow that makes trading there awesome",

One thing that I sadly though either misunderstood or where I'd wish it was easier to aget information / maybe a small hint that funds can be lost is -- liquidity pools. I did read about how they work and my impression was that IL just applied to unrealized profit, and that since the value in the vault should stay the same, the value in the vault stays the same. Yet I experienced today that i had less value when exiting the pool than when entering. The entirer concept of IL is highly confusing and many people doon't realize that they can lose a good portion of their funds when joining a LP. Actually given how they 'should' work it's still not quite clear to me. Because iiirc one of the fundamentals of a LP is that the value inside is constant, hence should people sell one asset in favor of ETH more of that asset is being added and some eth taken out, but not changing the overall value for the LP. Well my experience was quite different (and no, i provided a high mc coin + eth , so not a scamtoken or such_ Thanks.",

   "Content": "Hello, So we all know that Defi is clogging the Eth network and the gas fees is going higher. Unfortunately, the best solution is for Ethereum to be scalable which could possibly happen after Ethereum 2.0 which is far away out. Currently, different projects are trying different things to cope with high Ethereum gas fees- creating projects on complementing blockchains like Binance Smart Chain or Tron. Also, some projects are trying to group transactions to reduce gas costs. All of the above haven‚Äôt shown much promise though. Binance Smart Chain or Tron did not attract the same kind of following that Uniswap did. It could be partly due to the fact that Uniswap team is very competent and have a created a modern UI with a new pricing engine for trading. I think the best thing would be if Uniswap tried to implement Uniswap product on another blockchain like Polkadot etc. if you guys can keep the UI modern and simple just like it is right now then I‚Äôm pretty sure users will start using it way more happily than they are currently doing for Binance Smart Chain or Tron. Have you guys thought about implementing something like that?  That could be the best possible answer to high Eth gas fees for the current industry. Other projects don‚Äôt match Uniswap competency and capability to create something great like Uniswap on another blockchain. Can you guys take on that challenge? Thanks",

So if a new project just locks the liquidity for 1 month I probably won't trust them as much as a project that locks liquidity for 2 or more years.",

Rather we wanted to be critical, but cooperative.\n\nThe idea threading the narrative isn't that triangular arbitrage is bad per se, but rather that this special type of triangular arbitrage (which appears to exploit Uniswap's particular routing mechanism) is. As for whether or not there is a draining effect, I'd love to hear what you make of the example provided in the article & the bot's tx history",

For now, this problem is in the early stage, but as is my understanding, this can be a critical thing in the future, and everyone is forced to add liquidity only with pairs containing WETH, DAI, USDC, USDT, MKR and COMP...\n\nThe bots are just one consequence of this issue, and they're always R&D how to improve themselves day by day. I talked with many members from the DFOhub and other communities that are constantly sending me upgrades of this thing.\n\nSo the article works as an advice for communities to avoid the issue and for the Uniswap team to consider that this is a real problem which is growing and, if possible, do something about it.",

So basically, the way it works is that for a new project you advertise them on Uniswap and users stake UNI tokens to get rewarded in the new project's tokens. The new project give you a pool of tokens. Basically staking UNI tokens to yield farm the new project tokens (Example: https://launchpad.binance.com/en/lottery/15954e22173249078a1d5bb3a3ebe606).

What we have seen in yield farming projects is that these APY rewards demolish the price since users keep on cashing out on the rewards. There is not even 1 yield farming project that has seen a sustainable price increase. If possible, please end the UNI rewards program a little early if it continues to impose sell pressure on price. When in doubt just look at what Binance is doing (via their website). All there strategies boost there BNB token's price (they yield farm other project's token while staking their own. So the sell pressure via cashing rewards is on the other token).",

In general, the proposals should be more prominent.

But I do think an indicator in the header (an unread dot for instance) could be a subtle way to prompt people to check that tab. \n\nAnother option is to query on whether the wallet holds UNI to show or hide some popups when a new proposal is active, but again my hunch is that most folks would find it annoying except the most hardcore governance users :)\n\nOn thing I'm excited to see is the progress of project like https://www.boardroom.info/ and https://withtally.com/ for the more governance intensive tools. Similar to how the Uniswap app is the minimum viable product and more complex interactions that serve a smaller but more pro userbase are built externally like http://uniswaproi.com",

   "Content": "sharing feedback I posted in general earlier\nJust wondering, for tax purposes, when you provide liquidity and get LP tokens (as far as I understand it, this is considered selling 2 coins and purchasing an LP token)\nin terms of tracking the LP tokens, why are they always just named \"uni-v2\"?\nSo in my tax tracking software, I need to manually manage which tokens follow which coin pairs and its fine as I've only provided for 1 pair so far, but if I had 50 different LP tokens all called uni-v2 it'd be crazy annoying\nWould it be possible to have all the Lp tokens have an actual name, even if its just uni v2 usdteth for example",

The reason why the LP token is NOT named uniquely is because it is the claim on the deposited tokens.  I strongly cautioned you not to recognize the changes to the LP tokens value as income.  Your recognized gain or loss of capital is the difference between the deposited token and the withdrawn (when you burn the LP token), this is a capital gain or loss of the underlying tokens. It is entirely possible that the tokens value goes to zero while in the contract. If you had tried to recognize periodic changes as income, you would then have to declare a total loss in this scenario. Don't try to make this more complicated than it is.",

And I think your analogy of a deposit slip breaks down because the LP tokens are not tied to a specific amount of tokens (as the ratios may change) and they are not tied to a % of the pool either (as other depositors may enter or leave).\n\nWhen you enter the pool, you provide things of value (matched tokens) and receive Value1 in LP tokens in return.  When you leave the pool, you return those LP tokens (to be burned), and receive Value2 worth of the two corresponding tokens.  Value2 - Value1 is a capital gain (or loss) incurred at the time of exit.",

In my opinion there is a special responsibility of the folks that have been around crypto for a while to actively share knowledge about best practices, privacy, security, etc. Uniswap is attracting a giant number of new users in crypto and posting TX hashes and account screenshots in a public forum should not be taken so lightly. Thoughts?",

Uniswap tells you the prices accessible on the uniswap protocol, uniswap wouldn't tell you an other price because it can't create money out of thin air.\n\n> And they have so high fees also\nUniswap has a `0.3%` fee, the high fee you see aren't uniswap fee, they are ETH network fees paid to miners, uniswap is gonna release an L2 solution in hopefully jully, there is also ETH 2.0 that should lower the gas price too.",

Instead of paying the swap fee, you get a maker rebate, and I think this feature will be popular.\n\nThis would be a big help, but if you really wanted to support limit orders you could also add a limit order flag that only provides liquidity in one trade direction so that its not possible to have your order reversed by the price moving back across your limit price before you can withdraw the liquidity.",

Some ideas:\n1. Hide pools where both pairs are not available on any common exchanges (or maybe just make a whitelist manually).\n2. Hide pools until they have done a certain number of transactions -- at least force the scammers to eat gas fees to become visible.\n* In both cases you could let people still find them if they are willing to check a box or etc to \"Show all pools\"",

It makes no sense at the moment to remove your entire pool to create a new one because of the fees. \nFor example if you set a range 3000-6000 first time (eth-usd) and then ETH goes to 3000, you will end up with no more usdc. \nIt would be much more smart to be able to add back only usdc since you have much more than enough eth already. \nDoing that would decrease the first range for example adding only usdc would change from 3000-6000 range to 2000-6000.\nThe top range stays the same since you didnt add ETH. I think this is needed in future versions.",

   "Content": "2 main things that need to be simplified for V3 mass adoption are as follows:\n\n1) Add Liquidity: Simplify \"Price Range\" section to not be ratios but simple dollar values. Ratios are very confusing for average users. Eg for ETH/LINK pair, Min Value for LINK could be $30 and Max value could be $100 where the user wants to provide liquidity. Current price is $50. Why do we need to specify LINK value in terms of Eth? Why can't the user select that he/she wants to provide liquidity for LINK token between $30 and $100. Simple. This could be just 2 input boxes or a range selection with 2 button sliders.\nThe ratio logic if needed should be handled by your backend without exposing it to the user\n\n2)Simplify \"Liquidity Distribution\" chart under Pools for a token so the user can quickly read it at first glance. Again  avoid using ratios and plain dollar values for the token. We should be able to look at the chart which should be in eg LINK dollar value where most liquidity is provided. The user should not have to convert anything in his/her head or via a calculator.\n\nWe have news articles making fun of V3 that you need a Masters Degree on how to set the Price Range while providing liquidity on V3 : https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-fees-sting-but-uniswap-v3-see-more-volume-on-launch-day-than-v2-s-first-month",

Many of the current users have unveiled bugs through expensive usage but receive no compensation. Seeing how inactive governance is, i dont see this happening.\n\nAlso feedback on mobile usage of uniswap info, when looking at recent swaps the mobile cuts off the amounts of the trades.

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange, it's just a tool to interact directly with contracts easier. Uniswap is never in control of your funds or you transactions like a centralized exchange is. You should stick to centralized exchanges that offer the coins you want if you want more support and lower fees. Most swaps made within centralized exchanges are just numbers being moved on an excel spreadsheet on the backend of the website. The fees are lower because they don't actually have to process a transaction unless you are transferring tokens to an external wallet. Unfortunately with decentralized exchanges you're on your own, but you also have complete control over what you are doing.",

Lost $45 fee for nuthin using Uniswap for the first time.",

It's hard for those of us who have been using DeFi tools for a while to relate, but important to remember that our mistakes (and most of us have plenty of failed txs in our event histories) cost us only a tiny fraction of what it's costing newcomers now. I think more of us would have been similarly turned off, and maybe not come back, had this happened to us like that.",

   "Content": "Hard to not bring this back up, but its true that Uniswap cannot prevent rising gas prices for transactions. Think of Uniswap as a toll freeway for cars. The more people using that freeway, the more congestion there is, this causes strain on the miners that process and record transactions like the two you were sending. They reverted due to some kind of error, likely related to all the other people that were trading FAR more in value. Those people (or other aggregators) will pay higher gas fees in order to be handled by miners first or sooner. You sent those transactions during a time of exceptionally high gas prices. And if your transaction succeeded, you would have paid even more gas for each of them. Checkout the eatherscan gas tracker before sending transactions, no matter what the platform.  https://etherscan.io/gastracker",

I nearly moved all my tokens to a new wallet n vowed never to use your app again, as a user, I suggest bringing in some kind of manual connect/disconnect wallet feature like pancake swap that would bring peace of mind to users for the future. Now, I fully accept I might be suggesting something that‚Äôs hard to do or pull off because I‚Äôm not a dev but it really needs seeing to......and coming with ‚Äòthe issues are on trust wallets side‚Äô isn‚Äôt good enough in my opinion as a user, trust wallet and uniswap need to liaise with each other on this and get it sorted or your users are going to become targets of hackers/scammers and they will scream high and low about how uniswap and trust wallet got me hacked because of a poor wallet connect feature. I hope you take this well and at the very least look into this, thank you!",

In the last week gas has gone from $8 a swap to over $200 and that cycle has been going all of 2021. Check the charts and wait for the gas fee to be 5-10% of what your trading and stop complaining to teams that are not ETH devs\n\n2) Uni v3 is brand new! It's confusing as hell and doesn't have enough use to pull any meaningful metrics to base pros and cons on. Be patient, let it settle, go out side, and chill\n\n3) if you've been in crypto for more than a couple mo ths you should know better than to dive head first into a brand new project without reading every single post by the project, joking ever social media group, and reading the last week or two of comments on all of them. If you're not doing that, then you're setting yourself up to have your false expectations rekt\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è",

I know there's a regular message/warning about the risks but can a function that'll actually pick on a scam token be created?. It doesn't seem that hard to implement either. Once a pool is created have uniswap just go to the sell and approve functions enter in a few random wallet address and if they're able to sell great (returns true), if not, an additional message can be shown. This will have more of an effect of preventing these scams.",

Am I missing something? I mean, I'm gonna have to migrate to v3 since charting for v2 is gone.\n\n(EDIT: that is to say, if v3 is designed to replace v2, then I will have to migrate eventuallly.

   "Content": "Having, potentially, three different liquidity pools for every different token by different fee structure seems bad, as it lowers liquidity in each separate pool and therefore reduces the utility of uniswap as a market, and means that sometimes there may be some people conducting multiple ETH transactions within uniswap just for arbitrage, which just seems wasteful of gas and blockchain space\nAlternative proposal, assuming that it is feasible:\n\nWhen submitting liquidity, each person votes on what their preferred fee for the pool is, in sensible increments (e.g. of 0.001%) and with some reasonable cap that should probably be a *little* higher than 1% IMO (there are some low volume shitcoins out there).\nWhen a swap transaction is submitted, the actual market maker fee for the swap is calculated as the value-weighted average of the votes of the marginal liquidity at that price point (e.g. someone wants to swap some X for Y. The fee for this, allocated to each \"in range\" share of the pool, would be the sum of each liquidity provider's fee multiplied by their fraction of the volume of the swap txn that will be used). Instead of a straight weighted average, an alternative algorithm could be used such as ignoring values past some number of standard deviations away from the average in either direction to reduce the effect of outlier parties trying to raise the fee too high for example, although this is part of the rationale behind a fee cap mentioned earlier.\nThere is then a market mechanism to encourage dynamically adjusted fees for the pools as market volatility conditions change; to make the fees affordable enough to be competitive with other swapping services while still being profitable enough to attract liquidity to the pool\nUniswap avoids a situation where FEI/USDC 0.3% and FEI/USDC 1% pools are both in the top 20 by daily volume, as they are currently. Instead there would be a single FEI/USDC swap pool, with a fee that would probably be somewhere between 0.3% and 1%",

Fee data appears auto-calculated and is likely incorrect, giving LPers (myself among them) an over-optimistic performance. I initially found this out when my UNI/ETH LP appeared to be gaining rewards much slower than expected.\n\nIs this a known bug, or maybe there is something on my browser / connection that is not propogating the data?

Perhaps there are more things that a DAO should not be able to do than what it was intended for? Perhaps the Voting parameters need to be changed. Maybe you need to register with a Ip address and name, gov id. But allowing someone to vote more than once or based on share size lends itself to manipulation. DAO manipulation should be closely examined and I hope to here from your team about this.",

More tokens will be bridged to Optimistic Ethereum over the coming days and weeks.\"  https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-optimism-alpha/  But may I suggest that along with allowing more tokens, you also allow the bridge (https://gateway.optimism.io/) to transfer not only those tokens, but also v3 liquidity pool NFTs?  For example, I could save a lot on fees if I just transfer, say, 1 ETH to L2.  Then once on L2, swap as much of the ETH as I need into various tokens, and then create the v3 liquidity pool NFTs.  Finally, if I could, I could then bridge back those NFTs through the gateway back to L1.  I don't think there's a reward for good Feature Requests, but if so, email me awbvious@awbvious.com .

The governance owns `uniswap.eth` and `uniswap.eth` has an IPFS field, you could setup a vote to downgrade it to a lower version, or fork and remove all of that and also the SEC and FCC enforcement if you want.\nI think you should go to https://gov.uniswap.org and open a temperature check to change this instead of ranting here, this would be a more productive use of all our time.",

It would be a real nice to have if I could do - ETH/USDC pool eth price: 2000 pool bounds 1500 - 2500 input USDC input 2000 ETH input 0 and then either the app or a contract facilitates the swap before putting the correct amount into the pool. That way I can have put as much as I want into a pool with 1 action and not have to swap a second time because I am bad at math.\n- For removing liquidity from a pool, It would be nice to have the option to withdraw my position and choose the allocation of assets. Lets say I am in a pool of USDC/ETH and my position is out of range so my position is 100% USDC. I would like to withdraw my liquidity, but swap it all to ETH so that I can ride the gravy train up the hill!",

Thought this might be helpful from both a branding perspective, but also to truly decentralize the app itself.\n\nSeems like there was some interest from Hayden back in the day for .uniswap/ too https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1282862591694573569\n\nThoughts?",

As a part of a general push to improve our onboarding experience, we'd love to chat with a few of you about your user experience of onboarding into crypto generally, but also about your first time using Uniswap. The interview would center around learning a bit more about you, how and why you started using Uniswap, and what motivations drive you to learn and explore more. The chat should only last about 20 minutes, and participants will be compensated for their time. If interested, please DM me!",

   "Content": "Per the rekt article that just came out: https://rekt.news/uniswap-v3-lp-rekt/\n\nI think there's a very easy, elegant solution to the problem of \"just-in-time (JIT) liquidity.\"\n\nFirst alert developers of this upcoming change.  Give them a month to update their code.  Then for a month or two, create a banner on the swap page:\n\n\"We've just introduced a new feature: Just-in-Time Liquidity protection. You can read about it here [medium link].  All existing liquidity will have it, and any new liquidity added through uniswap.org will as well, unless you choose to select Advanced -> Instantly Removable -> On.\"\n\nThe medium article can read: \n\nBots can front-run normal liquidity providers by quickly adding and removing liquidity when they see a large swap is about to occur.  They do this within the same block, so they can prevent \"impermanent loss\" and use very concentrated liquidity settings that will get maximum preference for fees.\n\nPreventing Just-in-time (JIT) liquidity helps everyone but the bots:\n\n- Non-bot users will get more fees as the fees are no longer going to bots\n- Uniswap will have more liquidity, as non-bot users by necessity have to provide more liquidity than bots, because non-bot users cannot know when swaps will happen and must spread their assets\n- Swappers will have more liquidity at their disposal and thus they will get better rates\n\nFrom now on, unless a user selects Advanced -> Instantly Removable -> On, their liquidity will not be removable for the duration of 1 block (approximately a few seconds) and will thus be given fee preference to liquidity providers who either: A) provide via the UI with the \"Instantly Removable\" feature \"On\" or B) provide liquidity programmatically without the new optional parameter of instant_liquidity as FALSE.",

   "Content": "Basically, the UI sets the instant_liquidity as FALSE by default, unless a user purposely changes it to \"On\"/TRUE.  However, programmatically, the default is set as TRUE unless unless the code purposesly sets it as FALSE.\n\nAgain, the instant_liquidity parameter will be TRUE by default going forward, thus those who add programatically using legacy code will still be able to do so, but unless they add this parameter, their liquidity will not be given preference.  Thus legacy code should be updated.  (We reached out to the development community a month ago to prepare them for this change.)\n\nWhatever the instant_liquidy parameter is set during the providing of liquidity, sets the parameter on the liquidity NFT.\n\nAs for those who provided liquidity before this change by any means, all existing v3 NFTs before this change have been set as instant_liquidity FALSE.  Thus old holders of liquidity do not have to do anything.  Further, no user would need instant_liquidity as TRUE, as enough time has passed that they can all safely remove liquidity by now.\n\nWe hope this will thwart JIT liquidity.  If it proves to not be sufficient to simply give preference to those with instant_liquidity FALSE, then a new fee preference structure may be created where preference is not only determined by the tightness of the liquidity range but also the length of time providing liquidity.  However, we hope/think this will suffice, and will attempt this first.\n\nThanks.",

   "Content": "That's a good point, so if there was significant desire to counteract JIT-liquidity (again, not yet proven) either: A) make an \"update\" per my original idea, a v3.1 and a liquidity migration, but instead of preventing removal of liquidity within the same block, prevent removal of liquidity prior to the next rebalancing.  Thus, they can't do such a super-narrow liquidity range.  Or.   B) Rather than play cat and mouse trying to figure out the optimal amount of time, again, create a v4 which is the same as v3 except the longer you keep assets in your v3 positions the more you can \"transfer\" to the v3 that is currently being used for a swap.  E.g. Alice and Bob have got two pools ETH/USDC and WBTC/USDT, $50 in each, and Alice has had them for 10 days while for Bob has had them for 20 days.  Alice and Bob are the only liquidity holders fro WBTC/USDT.  A trade is going to happen on WBTC/USDT.  At the best rates possible, with zero fees, for each, some ETH and USDC is traded for WBTC and USDT (maybe the ETH goes through the ETH/WBTC pool and the USDC goes through the USDC/USDT pool).  Since Alice was holding for half the time of the other liquidity holder, $50 of ETH/USDC is added to her WBTC/USDT pool, making it now $150 in size.  For Bob, all $100 is transferred, making it $200 in size.  The trade goes through, and then, with zero fees, the WBTC/USDT goes back to ETH/USDC pool.  Now, let's say there's Charles, he's got $100 ETH/USDC and nothing in WBTC/USDT.  He sees in the mempool that a transactions coming, so he put in $100 WBTC/USDT.  Well, nearly none of his ETH/USDC will move over since it's been less than a second since he added to WBTC/USDT (time of holding can be determined by whichever is most recent, either the recipient or the sender, in such a liquidity transfer), which is barely anything compared to 10 days or 20 days.",

As it is, I had excellent help on my trouble ticket here in Discord and I was able to be on my way after a few short minutes.  Many thanks to your team!",

See here, from the uniswap blog:\n\n\"Swap and Add\nThe new router contract now offers an atomic ‚Äòswap-and-add‚Äô function that makes it possible to provide liquidity with only one of the asset‚Äôs in the pool, or any ratio of the two assets.\n\nIn order to add liquidity to a Uniswap v3 pool, the user or contract must provide two assets in a particular ratio. In many cases, the user only holds a single asset or an arbitrary ratio of the two assets. This means you often have some tokens left over after adding liquidity. A simple approach is to submit a swap transaction to reach the optimal ratio and then submit an add liquidity transaction -- but your swap (and other transactions in between) will have changed the optimal ratio!\n\nThe new SwapRouter makes it possible to swap and then add liquidity in a single atomic transaction. The smart-order-router npm package even includes a function to compute the optimal ratio and transaction calldata. Check out this new developer guide to learn how to swap-and-add in your project today.\"",

   "Content": "Hello - I'm not too tech savvy but have read great things about v3 as well as some concerns.\nI got the hint that to increase stability, efficiency in pools swap and of course, fees would only be capable if there was no auto-compound and you had to harvest your own words pro-actively.\nI did some basic math and was wondering if the utility and economic benefit of v3 will offset the losses from not being able to harvest your trades daily due to gas costs.\nIf you receive a 40% APR on a $5,000 investment, you'll make $2,000 w/o compounding and assuming your (r) holds.  If you were compounding daily, you would return an APY% of 49.15 and earn an additional $457 on your trade.  Assume all of it gets reinvested.\nIf you took a modest gas fee of $25,  (mine 1hr ago EST) in v3 to harvest $5.40 was $70.00, you would lose your entire profit by the ~18th time you selected to compound during the year.\nI'm not tech-savvy.  Please let me know how this helps the long position in the LP.  I'm going to assume if Uniswap doesn't put a lot of literature out for the amateurs (learning in progress) - people are going to panic.  Really, any new asset manager, bank, pension, endowment, insurance co, and or corporate who are making big pushes to tell their bosses how this could make sense w/o massaging a white paper.   They gripe when their cash balances are off by 5bps.",

   "Content": "Imo you understood it well, harvesting too often isn't reasonable, as moving funds on mainchain in general. You can go through the math behind it in detail, but imo more important difference between uniV3 and V2 is the higher capital efficacy due to smaller trading range that comes on the other hand with the drawback that you have to decide which kind of range you like to choose. While V2 was a 'put in and forget' game V3 needs more care. And ofc both protocols still have their value in a balanced portfolio. btw, I still have liquidity in uniV1;-)",

As a LP I'd really like to know what percentage of fees I'll earn in the different price zones\n- price range input is quite inaccurate, the percentage of the price boundaries changes based on zoom level despite the value price boundaries remaining the same\n- token conversion rates are truncated at relatively low digit counts making it cumbersome to use with tokens which have a very small / large prices relative to each other (<1.0e-5 or >1.0e+6 )\n- lack of \"reinvest button\" for individual positions: seeing as the NFT Liquidity Position Manager implements a `multicall` method it'd be really cool to be able to leverage that directly in the UI and combine different operations such as withdrawing fees and depositing them into your position or even withdrawing from multiple positions in a single transaction\n\nPlease don't take this feedback the wrong way, I really think V3 is cool and the UI despite its flaws is great. As a smart contract and frontend dev myself I understand how hard it can be to integrate everything, I can't wait to see how you improve the frontend in the future. Do you guys maybe have a recommendation for other frontends I could use to manage V3 LP positions?",

They have a price that is very far from market, and being the first person to add liquidity without being able to set the price is very risky. Maybe there could be a function to be able to re-initialise a dead pool for a specific fee tier in the same way that one is able to when starting a new pool in a fee tier that no one else has already initiated",

What are the reasons for uniswap to NOT connect with my wallet when i max the amount. protecting me from high gas? Or could it be that there isn't enough money in the pool for this swap? I don't get.

   "Content": "#feedback \n1. Open Uniswap on more chains.  suggest $TLOS $XDC $CSPR $DOT and $AVAX - These chains are faster, cheaper, and more scaleable than ETH and MATIC. Be a first mover and reap the rewards of those communities using your DEX. The more chains UNI is on the better for UNI and customers because they know what they are getting and they know it will be secure. It allows UNI to be the goto DEX on all the chains.\n\n2. After UNI is solidified on more chains there are more options to further enhance UNISWAP interoperability between chains. A partnership with Celsius Network would allow for secure bridging between chains. For example if you had liquidity pairs that were the same on multiple chains say ETH, MATIC, and TLOS a partnership with CelsiusX could pull liquidity from one chain and bridge liquidity where it is needed most on another. This would make Uniswap an unstoppable awesome multi-chain DEX that no other Dex has been able to do yet. It also allows for liquidity and assets to flow where they are best treated if a chain is experiencing high demand and high gas a user could opt to do their exchange on another chain and the liquidity if needed could flow where it is best treated and used. Users and Liquidity providers would all benefit because their assets would not be stove-piped on one chain.\n\n3. Uni governance could implement a small fee or a range of possible fees so as not to harm liquidity providers from all transactions across all chains paid out to UNI holders. This would increase value of UNI and pay holders to continue to hold it. It would incentivize LPs to also hold UNI so as to benefit from that fee. These Fees could all be converted in bulk from native transaction currencies to UNI once a month and distributed out to UNI token holders like a dividend.",

It would be chain agnostic and move where it is needed or demand is there. The LP providers would basically be providing a universal pool of liquidity across all supported chains/networks. They win because there liquidity and fees are not stuck on one chain/network. Users win because they can buy or sell on the best most operable chain again not stuck on one. UNISWAP wins because it would be the the only dex competitive with cEXs but would probably have way more volume and if they turn on UNI dividend via tiny fees UNI would be the exchange of exchanges to hold long term. Celsius wins because they would employ CelsiusX on a huge scale. Everyone wins through a level playing field and the UNISWAP network would not be able to be taken down.",

The problem should be drastically reduced if/when ETH shifts from POW to POS. Even after the shift I think other networks will still be cheaper and probably faster as well. The main things going for ETH is the amount of development that has already happened on the network. Although most new builds are going to other chains/networks now. if/when it shifts to POS fees should come down drastically to probably less than $5 a transaction (still not great compared to others but a major improvement to ETH). Finally ETH will become deflationary which if demand remains should be good for ETH price. I am not confident demand will increase or remain though because most other chains/networks are already better than ETH and most of them are going to be able to scale better too which will continue to steal market share and demand from ETH Over the long run",

Makes Uniswap unstoppable because if a chain/network usage is very high but liquidity in said pair is minimal the LP could move to a less congested chain or if a chain tries to shut down the liquidity on that chain could be moved to another chain for use. Although to bridge safely in these cases a partnership with CelsiusX and/or chainlink would be needed. They can confirm assets and LP values on a chain and destroy on that chain as they move/create the same on another chain. NO ONE has solved this problem yet like CelsiusX but they are not a DEX they could work well with a DEX like Uniswap but would need an interchangeable DEX on multiple chains/networks. I recommend UNI expand from ETH and MATIC to TLOS, ALGO, XDC, CSPR, etc. Then partner with CelsiusX to help safely bridge assets and/or LP to multi-chains.",

It seems that there's no way of knowing on-chain whether there has been a full or only partial exit from their position. Making it difficult to determine the gain from when they started providing liquidity. I have come to a partial conclusion that the UNIv3 pools unlike the UNIv2 pools are nontaxable transactions. If someone could DM me, I can explain further or perhaps get in touch with your legal team.",
